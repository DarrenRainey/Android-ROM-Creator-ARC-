# Android ROM Creator ARC
Android ROM Creator (ARC) is a easy to use guided/automated build system for Android ROM developers

# Usage
Run Menu.py with python and setup or install your repo currently all devices will use this repo to build from. Next select LineageOS and select Build ROM then select your devices after this almost everything will be automated except for one part that requires you to connect your device to extract some files.

# TODO
 * Add Alternative ROMS
 * Add Custom Configurations
 * Add Support For More Devices
 * Command line Arguments
 * Add APP Injector to include custom apps/binarys in Generated ROM's
